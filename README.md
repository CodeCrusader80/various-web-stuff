<h1>This repository will contain some web elements that I have to design 👨‍💻</h1>

<p>If you are looking for some clarification on how certain objects work on the web you have come to the right place since in this repository I will post from time to time (only when it is worth it) some web elements like sliders, effects parallax etc... Which can help you develop vothers or use them in one of your projects. Do not hesitate to leave a small star just for the form and if my work interests you do not forget to subscribe I publish quite regularly 🤙</p>

<h3> 📖 The slider Side :</h3>
<hr>
<p>It's a slider that works with a side menu on the left. This same menu contains the browser to switch from one view to another but also information on the project or any other data related to the complete slide that is displayed on the right. For the sake of responsiveness there is obviously a break made at 740px to make everything pass in block and thus with the menu at the top and the display of the content at the bottom.</p>
